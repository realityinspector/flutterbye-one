## Technical Implementation Details

### Lead Sharing Logic

1. When creating a lead, user can choose to save to personal or to team.
2. If saving to team, the lead will be created with `organizationId` set and `isShared` flag set to true.
3. When fetching leads, the API will combine:
   - User's personal leads (`userId = currentUser.id AND organizationId IS NULL`)
   - All team leads from organizations the user is a member of (`organizationId IN (user's organizations) AND isShared = true`)

### Organization Membership Flow

1. User creates an organization and becomes its admin
2. Admin can add users by their username or email (must be registered in the system)
3. Added users can view and interact with all team leads

### Data Update Handling

- All team leads will be globally accessible to team members
- No check-out or parallel update management required (per requirements)
- Last update wins in case of parallel edits

## Future Enhancements (Not in Current Scope)

- Activity feed showing team member actions
- Lead assignment between team members
- Record locking during edits
- Team-level analytics
