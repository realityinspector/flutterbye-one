OpenAI: o1-mini
213M tokens
The latest and strongest model family from OpenAI, o1 is designed to spend more time thinking before responding.  The o1 models are optimized for math, science, programming, and other STEM-related tasks. They consistently exhibit PhD-level accuracy on benchmarks in physics, chemistry, and biology. Learn more in the launch announcement.  Note: This model is currently experimental and not suitable for production use-cases, and may be heavily rate-limited.

OpenAI: ChatGPT-4o
1.05B tokens
OpenAI ChatGPT 4o is continually updated by OpenAI to point to the current version of GPT-4o used by ChatGPT. It therefore differs slightly from the API version of GPT-4o in that it has additional RLHF. It is intended for research and evaluation.  OpenAI notes that this model is not suited for production use-cases as it may be removed or redirected to another model in the future.

OpenAI: GPT-4o (2024-08-06)
632M tokens
The 2024-08-06 version of GPT-4o offers improved performance in structured outputs, with the ability to supply a JSON schema in the respone_format. Read more here.  GPT-4o ("o" for "omni") is OpenAI's latest AI model, supporting both text and image inputs with text outputs. It maintains the intelligence level of GPT-4 Turbo while being twice as fast and 50% more cost-effective. GPT-4o also offers improved performance in processing non-English languages and enhanced visual capabilities.  For benchmarking against other models, it was briefly called "im-also-a-good-gpt2-chatbot"
