│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── CallModal.js         # Call initiation modal
│   │   └── CallFollowupModal.js # Post-call follow-up actions
│   └── services/
│       └── callService.js       # Call logging and management API
```

#### 4. Product Management & Shopify Integration
- Product catalog synchronized with Shopify
- Product sharing via email or SMS
- Custom product presentation flows
- Secure API integration with Shopify Admin API

```
├── src/
│   ├── screens/
│   │   ├── ProductsScreen.js    # Product catalog overview
│   │   ├── ProductDetailScreen.js # Detailed product information
│   │   └── ShareProductScreen.js # Product sharing interface
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── ProductSelector.js   # Product selection component
│   └── services/
│       └── shopifyService.js    # Shopify API integration methods
```

#### 5. Initial Setup & Configuration
- Guided setup wizard for first-time users

- Environment-specific configuration

```
├── src/
│   ├── screens/
│   │   └── SetupScreen.js       # Initial setup wizard
│   ├── contexts/
│   │   └── SetupContext.js      # Setup state management
│   └── services/
│       └── setupService.js      # Configuration API methods
```

#### 6. Core API & Data Services
- Centralized API client with error handling
- Offline data synchronization
- Secure storage for sensitive information
- Data validation with Zod schemas

```
├── src/
│   └── services/
│       ├── apiClient.js         # Core API service with interceptors
│       └── storage/
│           └── secureStorage.js # Device-secure data persistence
```

### Database Schema
The database schema will follow the existing structure with these core entities:

1. **Users** - Authentication and authorization information
2. **Leads** - Prospective customer contact information
3. **CallLogs** - Records of customer interactions
4. **Products** - Product information synced with Shopify
5. **AppSetup** - Application configuration

### Mobile-Specific Considerations

#### UI/UX Design
- Implement a mobile-first design approach with responsive components
